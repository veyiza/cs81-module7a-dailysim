# Reflection – Daily Schedule Simulator

## What was your approach to designing the schedule?
I just thought of random everyday things I do throughout the day and implemented them into the schedule.

## What was one challenge or unexpected behavior you encountered?
A challenge I encountered was keeping track of the timing for each event. 

## What does this assignment teach you about async code?
This assignment shows how async code doesn’t run top to bottom all at once. Different parts run later at scheduled times. In a regular script everything happens immediately in order but with async the browser waits and then runs each event later.

## What creative element did you add?
I added a random mood emoji that changes one of the activities each time the page runs.

## How does this project simulate or differ from real-world schedules?
This project simulates a real world schedule by adding random events that also happen in the real world. It's also realistic in terms of activities for each timing that happen throughout the day.
